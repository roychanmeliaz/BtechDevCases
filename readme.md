# Take-home Assignment: Auth with JWT (TypeScript)

Build a small application in **TypeScript/Go/C#** that supports user **registration** and **login** using **JWT**.
You can choose any stack or structure you want.
As long as the core flow works end-to-end, it’s accepted.
Please note User will be using the app in place with very bad connections, like jungle or caves.

## Requirements

### 1. Register

- Fields: `email`, `password`, `confirmPassword`

### 2. Login

- Input: `email`, `password`
- Return: **JWT**

  - `user id` or similar identifier

### 3. Authenticated View / Endpoint

```

user should be logged out after 15 minutes of inacitvity

### 4. Manager wallet

## What to deliver

- Fork this repository and then send the link
- A runnable project (any structure).
- README explaining:
  - How to build and run it (prepare docker compose)
  - Required environment variables

---

## Acceptance criteria

- Registration works with validation.
- Login returns a usable JWT.
- A protected route or screen shows the welcome message using JWT auth.
- User able to transfer funds

---

## Optional bonus

- Docker
- Backend built using Go (or their frameworks)
- Frontend built using React/Vue (or their frameworks)
- Tests (unit or integration)

This keeps the scope tight: just registration, login, and a protected “Hello [email]” flow.
